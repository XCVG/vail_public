**Created for 7dfps 2020 (https://itch.io/jam/7dfps-2020) and PROCJAM 2020 (https://itch.io/jam/procjam)**

**Version 1.0.0, 2020-12-05**

## Introduction

Bang Ouch Infinite is a first-person shooter with (nearly) infinite variation. It can be as silly or as profound as you want it to be.

## Content/Trigger Warnings

* Mild violence
* Mentions of/allusions to war
* Bright (though not flashing) colors

## Gameplay

kill the bad guy

## Controls

Mouse to look
WASD to move
Mouse1 to attack, Mouse2 to aim
Space to jump
Shift to run
E to interact
R to reload/holster

At any point, you may open the menu with Escape. You can also skip through cutscenes with E or Space.

## Hints

* The secret pacifist route from the original does something but is not the secret ending
* To get the secret ending you must take a third option
* There's a bonus in the secret ending, if you know where to click

## Known Issues

* The init screen is stretched on ultrawide displays (this is an upstream issue)
* Toggle group label text is not themed consistently (this is an upstream issue)
* A lot of warnings and non-fatal errors get vomited into the console because I got lazy
